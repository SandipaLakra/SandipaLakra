## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

"My name is Sandipa Lakra . I specialize in DL and ML algorithms and have completed a variety of projects using Python programming languages. My expertise includes machine learning models such as scikit-learn, Pytorch and TensorFlow, as well as deep learning models like multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. I have applied these models to various classification and regression tasks. Additionally, I have experience working with time series data for visualization and prediction using RNN and LSTM models.

I hold a Master of Science degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) Allahabad, and I have a strong foundation in Mathematics Specially in Statistics , Optimization , Linear Algebra , Tensor Analysis and Graph Theory concepts. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and approaches in the field and continually strive to enhance my skills and knowledge.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, including AI vs Real Image Detection : Comprehensive Deep Learning Approach ,Malaria diagnosis using modular coding, Loan Application prediction with logistic regression and random forest, Sales data analysis for optimization using tableau. These projects have involved the use of a variety of tools and techniques, such as Tableau, Business Analytics, MySQL, clustering, image processing, deep learning.
